# Landscape-Image-Generation-using-StyleGAN2-ADA


In this paper we propose a modified architecture
for generating HD quality images based on StyleGAN2 ADA
architecture. This paper presents a new architecture which is
evaluated on Landscape image dataset. The used landscape
dataset is one of the first to be benchmarked on StyleGAN-based
architectures. This dataset has potential to become standard
test for variety of generative tasks due to wide domain of
available images. Our method proposed a generative network
with ResNet backbone compared with skip network present in
previous StyleGAN architectures.

We have proposed an advanced method for generating
images that is capable of producing high-quality images, based
on a well-known model StyleGAN2 ADA. In this work, we
evaluate the modified generator architecture of StyleGAN2
ADA on Landscape dataset containing around 2500 mountain
images. The landscape images generated in this process seem
to have acceptable quality considering the amount of training
done. Training the StlyleGAN2 ADA model with a smaller dataset gave better results because it uses an adaptive discrim-
inator augmentation mechanism. The use of Modification with the ResNet backbone has increased the training time.
Although the baseline score is better than full augmentation
modified architecture, we found that modified architecture
produces more vivid images qualitatively. The results are
summarized in the results section with a detailed comparison
of their performance. The modifications were made in the
synthesis network which includes ResNet as the backbone and
using an augmentation pipeline for training. The advancement in StyleGAN2 ADA along with our experiments prove the
advantages of using smaller datasets which are capable of
yielding the same quality image.
