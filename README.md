# Landscape-Image-Generation-using-StyleGAN2-ADA


In this paper we propose a modified architecture
for generating HD quality images based on StyleGAN2 ADA
architecture. This paper presents a new architecture which is
evaluated on Landscape image dataset. The used landscape
dataset is one of the first to be benchmarked on StyleGAN-based
architectures. This dataset has potential to become standard
test for variety of generative tasks due to wide domain of
available images. Our method proposed a generative network
with ResNet backbone compared with skip network present in
previous StyleGAN architectures.
